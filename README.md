# Impact of Recruiting Number to Real Estate Price
Being the most expensive city to live in, the housing price of Seoul became a great indicator of the world's economy. 
Now, the price of other cities around the world follows that of Seoul. Before, the housing prices of New York and Tokyo foreshadowed the housing price of the world.
In other words, if you can analyze Seoul's housing price patterns, you will have a great edge in the market.

Everyone knows the price will go up when a company's headquarter moves into a city. 
However, not everyone knows when exactly the price will bump. 
A safe bet will be buying at very early.
But, even avoiding one-month mortgage interest can save your family's health and car insurance for a year.
So, what moves the housing market?
This project seeks to present one of the indicators, the changes in the recruiting number.
And the indicator can be applied to other cities around the world.
If you can get the recruiting number for the city of New York, or where you live in,
you have a higher chance of selling your house higher or buying your new house lower.
The biggest investment for a family is housing, why not take a look into this project?
